## Questions

- **Why is there a random emote at the end?**\
    Twitch doesnt allow the same message to be sent within 30 seconds of the previous message. This gets around that.
<br />

- **Why are the number of presses limited to 10?**\
    So that 1 person in chat can't do too many actions at a time.
<br />

- **Why can't different buttons be pressed in a message?**\
    So that when multiple people are playing, 1 person can't just automatically do a specific action chain. I want it to be a bit chaotic if there are a lot of people playing. It makes it more interesting.
